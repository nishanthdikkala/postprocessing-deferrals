Summary of the experiments performed:
1. Using deferrals on a single group to equalize the PDFs of the DOCS - deferral_equalize_pdf.R
2. Using deferrals on both groups via the min-PDF method to equalize the PDFs - deferral_min_pdf.R
3. Using deferrals with thresholds to equalize PPV and NPV across African-Americans and Caucasians simultaneously - deferral_thresholds.R
